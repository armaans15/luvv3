                    <p>
                        Ever since the day I first laid eyes on you and spoke to you, just the exchange of words has simply changed my life forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "life" being referenced is one that was barren, met with the same things day after day, no real goals in mind, no ambition but rather just endlessly living with no real purpose. I had to change, not only because a 10/10 entered my life but because I wanted to be great, have an amazing future for the both of us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Year ago today, I was half the programmer I am now, much weaker, not as emotionally intelligent, I was disatisfied with my life, but in all the disatisfaction, I knew one thing for sure, that I wanted you to be around, not only did you push me to be better but questioned things I never thought to questioned and just gave me a new outlook onto life as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love you so much because not only do you love me but because, in the tapestry of life, the brightest thread, A masterpiece of beauty, where words fall dead. Your smile, a sunbeam in my darkest day, With every glance, my worries fade away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My dearest tika pie, below you will find the reassurance that you did in my last letters, the reminders of love that kept you going that were unfortunately lost, but that isn't a concern because it is now better, so check here often because I always want to remind you just how beautiful you are just how much you mean to me and just how happy you make me!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing the joy on your face today brought me to slight tears(that you didn't notice hehe) but I wanted you to know that I really believe that you are a princess, I wish to spoil you for the rest of your life and to see you happy makes me want to tear up because it brings me so much happiness as well, I love you so much and I hope you have the best christmasss :D

                            love is holding you in arms and kissing your forehead as I let it out a big sigh and realize just why I do everything

                        I woke up this morning, feeling very tired although I was extremely excited for the day because this was a day I had been awaiting for weeks now! I packed up the gifts and got ready as I headed over to her house to deliever the long awaited items. I really hope she likes the purse!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I got closer to your house I was even more nervous about the gift and when you left the door to come to my car I was at a loss of words and my akwardity levels were higher than ever. I handed you the gifts with nervousness in my mind but you quickly met me with surprise, the gratefulness for even the smallest of items meant so much to me I felt like breaking down right then and there. And when you finally got to the end and saw the final gift I was so terrified, I guess even after all this time I still seek your best judgement, I learned once to always flirt with you and treat you like the prize you are so I still look for your approval every single day. That was very quickly shut down as you looked back at the gift and back at me wide eyed in disbelief, and then I felt a sense of relief although slight, but I was mostly overcome with joy, I was so happy to see you happy that I felt like breaking down and then I was attacked with kisses! The best moment of my life!

                        She always looks so beautiful, truly like a princess, the most gorgeous woman I've ever laid eyes on and I'm so happy that she's mine, Tika often tells me things that I didn't know about myself and it really reminds me just how much she cares for me, and in those moments I begin to feel even deeper in love with her. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To me, there is no sad days, as much as I'll try to be sad sometimes a simple phone call or even a text with some reaffirming words is enough to send me into a spiral! And she does just that for me. I'm infatuated!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, me and Tika have shared pleasure together and it's been the most amazing thing, I love getting to know more about eachother and I feel so comfortable in every single moment like that, I feel very safe and I love her so much for helping me feel this way to something so new to me, something that didn't exist before, and most of all it feels so right, I feel so happy and grateful that she loves me!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life with Tika is so endearing, I really feel like I've known her my whole life, everything prior to her existence in my life was just build up, I've accomplished so much and I can't wait to show her off to the world every day, she is my love, the woman of my dreams, my everything! I love you tika jaan!
                    </p>
