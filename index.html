                    <p>
                        Ever since the day I first laid eyes on you and spoke to you, just the exchange of words has simply changed my life forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "life" being referenced is one that was barren, met with the same things day after day, no real goals in mind, no ambition but rather just endlessly living with no real purpose. I had to change, not only because a 10/10 entered my life but because I wanted to be great, have an amazing future for the both of us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Year ago today, I was half the programmer I am now, much weaker, not as emotionally intelligent, I was disatisfied with my life, but in all the disatisfaction, I knew one thing for sure, that I wanted you to be around, not only did you push me to be better but questioned things I never thought to questioned and just gave me a new outlook onto life as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love you so much because not only do you love me but because, in the tapestry of life, the brightest thread, A masterpiece of beauty, where words fall dead. Your smile, a sunbeam in my darkest day, With every glance, my worries fade away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My dearest tika pie, below you will find the reassurance that you did in my last letters, the reminders of love that kept you going that were unfortunately lost, but that isn't a concern because it is now better, so check here often because I always want to remind you just how beautiful you are just how much you mean to me and just how happy you make me!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing the joy on your face today brought me to slight tears(that you didn't notice hehe) but I wanted you to know that I really believe that you are a princess, I wish to spoil you for the rest of your life and to see you happy makes me want to tear up because it brings me so much happiness as well, I love you so much and I hope you have the best christmasss :D

                        Hey darlingg, I woke up this morning feeling exhausted and I just wanted to lay down in bed until I eventually fall back asleep and this feeling was bearing strongly on me, sometimes i start feeling just down and I honestly have no reason why it just happens, but today i decided that I don't wanna feel down and this was a concept that you told me about, sometimes there were days where you wanted to feel a predisposed emotion, but you overcame that feeling and I did that too today jaan! Thank you for being not only the best lover I could've ever asked for but a teacher to me I have so much to learn from you and your unique approach to life is drowning in the sea of reasons as why I am infatuated with you!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       While I'm writing this I'm sitting in the Sam's Club parking lot I have to get some groceries hehe, but anyways there's so many things coming up in the next few months like my first semester of college being over, our 1 year anniversary, speaking of which feels so surreal it feels like I just met you but at the same time I've known you my whole life love I am shaped by my experiences with you and that's something that I realized in our year together. I'm soooo excited as well I feel like jumping off the walls and most of all I'm so grateful, also I know Im writing a lot I think I just had a lot to say but you can read it whenever you want lovee I know your stressed and overwhelmed from school work and I want you to know that i'm proud of you sweetie :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is my tika appreciation area and I just wanted to recognize how much your kind words mean to me love, you always speak to me so softly and reassuringly even in the worst personal moments and hardships hearing your voice has been a cure for me! And everytime you say your proud of me with your sweet voice I want to melt but also work a milllioonnn times harder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hey tika, just saying your very <em> Sexy </em> I'm literallly so attracted to you I feel tingly just writing this, I love seeing your beautiful curves wrapped up in your clothes and your pretty face I just wanna kiss every part of you omgg
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have my faults and flaws, in fact I think I'm riddled with them but you just bring out the absolute best in me love, I will always love you and be by your side. Up until meeting you in life, If I had the chance to relive life again, I would do the exact same thing I did before awaiting every single day until you sent me the letter :) you are the girl of my dreams You make every ounce of suffering that comes with life worth it, in fact it doesn't even feel like suffering whatsoever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've changed drastically since the day we met, but one change sticks out to me the most, I smile a lot more and laugh a little bit louder because I know that at the end of the day nothing can go bad because you are the light of my life. I love you!
                    </p>
